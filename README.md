# VectoReach
VectoReach is a Smart Ads Targeting system built by fusing text and image intelligence to deliver the right ad, every time. This project was built for Bigquery AI Hackathon 2025.

# Project Description
VectoReach is an AI-powered ad targeting platform that combines multimodal embeddings (text + image) with vector search to deliver highly relevant ads. Unlike traditional systems that rely on keywords or manual tagging, VectoReach understands both the ad copy and the visual creative, mapping them into a shared semantic space using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI Multimodal Embedding model. By storing these embeddings in BigQuery and using vector similarity search, VectoReach enables advertisers to:
• Find ads that are visually and textually similar to a given query (text, image, or
both).
• Match ads with audience interests more accurately, even when textual metadata
is incomplete.
• Scale to millions of creatives without manual labeling.

The result is a smarter, faster, and more precise targeting engine that works
seamlessly in real-time recommendation and ad-serving pipelines.
